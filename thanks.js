/*
 * Thank you all for an amazing summer!
 *
 * Although I couldn't meet any of you in person, I can't describe how
 * thankful I am to have had the opportunity to meet you all. I've never
 * worked with such smart, capable, and supportive people in my life!
 *
 * Thanks everyone, especially my mentor Sven, for treating me as a team member
 * and having the patience for my endless questions!
